    ALGORITHM:

    Given two extensions of the same degree defined by two different
    polynomials, we want to find, with the help of elliptic period, two elements
    with an unique orbit under the action of the Galois group. The algorithm is
    as follows :

        - First we have to find an integer m with the following properties :

            - We want to have n | phi(m) and (phi(m)/n, n) = 1.
            - We need m such that there exist an eigenvalue of the Frobenius of
              order n in (Z/m)* and for that egeinvalue to be of minimal order. 
              From there we can construct a good class for the trace of the 
              Frobenius, if we have one or more of those classes, we select 
              this m (note : for now, m is just a prime or a prime power).

          This is done by the function find_m.
    
        - After that, we need to pick a good elliptic curve. Which is an 
          elliptic curve defined over GF(q) with its trace of Frobenius has its 
          class modulo m equal to one of the good candidates, the one returned 
          by the function find_m. The properties on m ensure that the elliptic 
          curve over GF(q^n) has points of order m and that the abscissas of 
          such points span GF(q^n). The function doing that is 
          find_elliptic_curve.

        - Finally, we compute the elliptic periods u1 and u2 on both E/k1 and 
          E/k2 using the abscissas of a point of order m on each curves, 
          the isomorphism we are looking for is the one sending u1 on u2.

    From a point of order m on E/GF(q^n), we use its abscissas to generate a

    of the Galois groupe, we have (Z/m)* = <a> x S. To compute the elliptic
    periods, we use the formulas :

        - u = sum_{i \in S} (([i]P)[0])^2, for j not 0 nor 1728 or t = 0,
        - u = sum_{i \in S} (([i]P)[0])^4, for j = 1728,

    ALGORITHM:

    The goal is to pick an elliptic curve of which the trace of its Frobenius 
    t is among the right class modulo m, the ones in S_t. We do that in order to 
    have point of order m only on E/GF(q^n) or above, since then the abscissas 
    of a point of order m will span GF(q^n) and we'll be able to compute the 
    elliptic periods as it was planned.

    We start by looking at the two special cases j = 1728 or 0. If q is not 1 
    modulo 4 and 3 respectively, then the curves are supersingular (t = 0) and 
    if 0 is among the good traces, they are to be treated like the other 
    curves.

    If for j = 0 we have q = 1 mod 3, then we have to tests E(j = 0) and all of
    its sextic twists. Once again if t is in S_t, then we return the right 
    curves and the case 2 to compute the periods accordingly.

    If for j = 1728 we have q = 1 mod 4, then we have to tests  E(j = 1728) and
    all of its quartic twists. If one the trace is in S_t, we return the right 
    curves and the case 1.

    If j != 0 and 1728, then we tests all the elements of GF(q) to find the 
    right curve. For each j we test if t or -t is in S_t and return the curve 
    accordingly plus the case 0.

    If no curves are found, we return None and the case -1, which will raise an
    runtimeError in the main code.

    First and foremost we are looking for an integer m for which n | phi(m). A 
    good way to obtain such integers is to look for prime power of  the form 

    m = an + 1, 

    because then phi(m) = d.(an) which is divisible by n. We also want phi(m) 
    to be coprime with n, then choosing m to be a prime (which is possible 
    thanks to Dirichlet's theorem on the arithmetic progressions) we ensure 
    that it is actually the case.

    It still works fine, theoratically, if an + 1 is a prime power and d isn't 
    divisble by n. Though, we almost always get to pick a m that is prime.
