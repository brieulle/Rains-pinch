    ALGORITHM:

    TODO : Doc is deprecated, to be redone.

    Function that finds an elliptic curve with the required charateristics, 
    those given in the function isom_elliptic.

    First, we have to determine if m is composite, a prime power or a power of 
    p, the characteristic of the base field. The first case is not implemented 
    yet. 
    We also note that the m given should satisfies several conditions based
    on the characteristic and the degree of K. See the docstrings of 
    isom_elliptic for more information.

    - If m is a power of p, the charateristic of the base field k, then we shall
      proceed as follow :

        We pick a random curve E/k and we set down t = Tr_k(Fr_E), for the
        curve to be what we want, we need :

          - t not zero,
          - (Z/m)* = <t> x S or #<t> = n 
          - m divides #E/K but not #E/L, for any intermediate extension L 
            of K/k; so we can construct points of order m such that their 
            abscissas or ordinates span exactly K. Or that we haven't any point
            of order m in any sub-extension.

        Then we test those conditions for both E and its quadratic twist, if one
        of them meet the requirements, we return it and its trace. If no 
        elliptic curves are found an error is returned.

    - If m is primer power, then we shall proceed as follow :

        We have m = l^r, for l a prime. For this method to work, we need l to 
        be an Elkies prime. A prime l is an Elkies prime for an elliptic curve 
        if the charateristic polynomial of the aforesaid elliptic curve splits 
        in GF(l).

        For now, we pick a random curve E/k and for it to work, if we set down 
        t = Tr_k(Fr_E), we need the following :

          - We have x**2 - tx + q = (x - a)(x - b) mod m, meaning the polynomial
            splits in Z/m,
          - (Z/m)* = <a> x S, with #<a> = n, 
          - ord_m(a) < ord_m(b),
          - m divides #E/K but not #E/L, for any intermediate extension L 
            of K/k; so we can construct points of order m such that their 
            abscissas or ordinates span exactly K.

        Once again, we test all that for both E and its quadratic twist; if one 
        them meet the requirements, we return it, its trace and a tuple
        containing the root a and t mod m. If none are found, there is 
        something wrong.
